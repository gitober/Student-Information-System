# UserRepository Documentation

## Purpose

This interface represents the `UserRepository`, which provides methods to perform CRUD operations, custom queries, and specification-based searches for managing `User` entities in the database.

## Inheritance

- **JpaRepository<User, Long>**: Extends the Spring Data JPA repository interface to provide standard CRUD operations for the `User` entity.
- **JpaSpecificationExecutor<User>**: Extends the Spring Data JPA specification executor interface to provide support for complex queries using specifications.

## Custom Query Methods

- **findByUsername(String username)**: Retrieves an optional user by their username.
- **findByEmail(String email)**: Retrieves an optional user by their email address.

## Usage

This repository is used to manage `User` entities, providing methods for both basic CRUD operations, custom queries, and complex specification-based searches. The custom query methods allow for retrieving users by their username or email, which are essential for user authentication, authorization, and account management.
