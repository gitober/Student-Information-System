# DepartmentRepository Documentation

## Purpose

This interface represents the `DepartmentRepository`, which provides methods to perform CRUD operations and custom queries for managing `Department` entities in the database.

## Inheritance

- **JpaRepository<Department, Long>**: Extends the Spring Data JPA repository interface to provide standard CRUD operations for the `Department` entity.

## Custom Query Methods

- **findByName(String name)**: Retrieves an optional department by its name.

## Annotations

- **@Repository**: Marks this interface as a Spring Data repository, allowing it to be detected during component scanning and instantiated as a bean by Spring.

## Usage

This repository is used to manage `Department` entities, providing methods for both basic CRUD operations and custom queries. The custom query method allows for retrieving a department by its name, which is useful for ensuring uniqueness and managing department-related data efficiently.
