# DepartmentService Class Documentation

## Purpose

The `DepartmentService` class is responsible for managing department-related operations, such as retrieving, creating, and initializing departments. It helps to maintain department data and ensure that relationships between departments, teachers, and subjects are properly initialized.

## Dependencies

- **DepartmentRepository**: Used to access department data from the database.

## Fields

- **departmentRepository (DepartmentRepository)**: Repository for accessing department information.

## Methods

### Public Methods

- **findAll()**: Retrieves all departments from the database.
- **findDefaultDepartment()**: Finds a default department by name. If no department exists with the name "Default Department," it creates one.
- **findDepartmentWithRelations(Long departmentId)**: Loads a department by its ID with teachers and subjects initialized.

### Annotations

- **@Service**: Marks this class as a Spring service, allowing it to be automatically detected and managed by Spring's application context.
- **@Autowired**: Used to inject dependencies through the constructor.
- **@Transactional**: Ensures that the `findDepartmentWithRelations` method runs within a transactional context, allowing for lazy loading of relationships.

## Usage

The `DepartmentService` class is used to manage department data, including retrieving all departments, creating a default department, and initializing department relationships with teachers and subjects. It acts as a bridge between the application logic and the database, ensuring that department data is consistently managed and that relationships are properly loaded.
