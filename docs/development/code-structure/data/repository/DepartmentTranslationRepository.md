# DepartmentTranslationRepository Documentation

## Purpose

This interface represents the `DepartmentTranslationRepository`, which provides methods to perform CRUD operations and custom queries for managing `DepartmentTranslation` entities in the database.

## Inheritance

- **JpaRepository<DepartmentTranslation, Long>**: Extends the Spring Data JPA repository interface to provide standard CRUD operations for the `DepartmentTranslation` entity.

## Custom Query Methods

- **findByDepartmentIdAndLocale(Long departmentId, String locale)**: Retrieves a list of department translations for a specific department and locale.
- **findByLocale(String locale)**: Retrieves a list of all translations for a given locale.

## Annotations

- **@Repository**: Marks this interface as a Spring Data repository, allowing it to be detected during component scanning and instantiated as a bean by Spring.

## Usage

This repository is used to manage `DepartmentTranslation` entities, providing methods for both basic CRUD operations and custom queries. The custom query methods allow for retrieving department translations by department ID and locale, which are useful for displaying localized department information in different languages.
