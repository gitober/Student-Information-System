# Project Overview

The ***Student Information System*** is a web-based solution for managing student-related activities such as courses, grades, attendance, and profiles. Designed for students, teachers, and administrators, the system leverages Spring Boot for backend services and Vaadin for the user interface.

## Goals:

- Simplify academic data management for institutions.
- Provide role-based access for users (students, teachers, and administrators).
- Enable efficient management of courses, grades, attendance, and user profiles.

**Scope**: This project includes user registration, course enrollment, attendance tracking, grade management, and profile editing. It aims to streamline academic processes and enhance user experience through a user-friendly interface.

Below is an overview of the documentation to guide setup and maintenance.
